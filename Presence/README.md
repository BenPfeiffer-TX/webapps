# Web app 1: Presence: The Team Status Web Board 🧑💻
Presence is designed to be an 'at a glance' web page where team members can display their status. It allows users to quickly set their status to a variety of modes (available, lunch, in a call, etc.) and displays that information in an easy to read format.

## Key Takeaways 📝
---------------

Through building this application, I gained hands-on experience with:
* JSON Marshalling (encoding, decoding, appending to an existing .json file)
* Interactable HTML user interfaces


## Features ✨
-----
* Create new user entries
* Delete existing user entries
* Set a user status via a diegetic interface
* Display user status according to color code



## Running the Application 🎉
------------------------

To run the application, simply execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenPfeiffer-TX/webapps
cd webapps/Presence
go build . && ./main
```

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser to access the status board 🔗.
