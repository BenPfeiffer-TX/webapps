# Ben's web apps repository
In this public github repo I am storing my attempts at developing web applications in Go. This is intended to demonstrate my growth and understanding of the concepts behind web application development and practical usage of Go

## Project \#1: go wiki tutorial
[gowiki folder](gowiki)
* An HTTP server that displays Wiki articles and has a simple CRUD implementation

## Project \#2: Presence
[Presence](Presence)
* an "at a glance" attendance viewer for the OpenText technical support team to track availability / current status of people more readily than when checking Teams

## Project \#3: PfastChat
* A chatroom with session persistence (gorilla/websocket), a simple authentication page, JSON marshalling for storing credentials, and chat persistence. Find some way to incorporate concurrency?
